# date-fruit-classification
This project uses machine learning to classify date fruits based on appearance features like color, shape, length, and diameter, reducing manual effort and improving identification efficiency.


## Descripion 
This project focuses on classifying different types of date fruits using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains external appearance features such as color, shape, length, and diameter, which are key determinants of fruit type.
Seven date varieties are classified: Barhee, Deglet Nour, Sukkary, Rotab Mozafati, Ruthana, Safawi, and Sagai.
Exploratory Data Analysis and preprocessing are performed, followed by the implementation and comparison of three different machine learning classification models.
The goal of the project is to automate the fruit classification process, reducing manual effort and time required for visual identification.
